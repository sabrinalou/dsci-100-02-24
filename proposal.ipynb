    "**Question: Which physicochemical properties make a wine 'good' and how can we use this dataset so that a business can predict the quality of wine they produce based on its chemical composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Red wine is a popular type of wine made from dark-colored grapes, known for its rich flavor and complexity. Wine quality is typically evaluated based on factors such as aroma, taste, color, and acidity,etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    "There are 12 variables in this dataset:\n",
    "    Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "            1 - fixed acidity \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "            2 - volatile acidity\n",

    "        \n",
    "**Descriptions for variables : \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed acidity** refers to the non-volatile acids present in wine, which do not evaporate easily.\n",
    "**Volatile acidity** refers to the amount of acetic acid in wine, which can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste if present in excessive amounts.\n",
    "**Citric acid** is found in small quantities in wine and can add a sense of freshness and flavor to it.\n",
    "**Residual sugar** refers to the amount of sugar left over after the fermentation process is complete. Wines with less than 1 gram per liter are rare, while wines with more than 45 grams per liter are considered sweet.\n",
    "**Chlorides** refer to the amount of salt present in wine.\n",
    "**Free sulfur dioxide** exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 and bisulfite ion, and it helps prevent microbial growth and wine oxidation.\n",
    "**Total sulfur dioxide** refers to the amount of both free and bound forms of SO2. While SO2 is mostly undetectable in low concentrations, concentrations over 50 ppm can be detected in the taste and aroma of wine.\n",
    "**Density of wine** is close to that of water and depends on its alcohol and sugar content.\n",
    "**pH** measures the acidity or basicity of wine on a scale from 0 to 14, with most wines falling between 3 and 4.\n",
    "**Sulphates** are an additive in wine that can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas levels, acting as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.\n",
    "The percentage of **alcohol** content is an important factor to consider when assessing wine quality.\n",
    "**Quality** is the rated quality of the wine based on a sensory rating.\n"

    "Methods\n",
    "Explain how you will conduct either your data analysis and which variables/columns you will use. Note - you do not need to use all variables/columns that exist in the raw data set. In fact, that's often not a good idea. For each variable think: is this a useful variable for prediction?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct our data analysis we will:\n",
    "1. use cross validation to determine the best K nearest-neighbor value to use when creating a classifier, which ensures the highest prediction accuracy. \n",
    "2. preprocess, create model specification, and use the tuned classifier to predict the quality of the newly introduced wine. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns we will use:**\n",
    "The columns we will use when classifying will be pH, alcohol, sulphates, residual sugar, citric acid, and quality. The classifier variable is quality while the predictor variables are pH, alcohol, sulphates, residual sugar, citric acid, and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:**\n",
    "Since the rating of the quality is a scale from 0 to 10 (distinct numerical values) and is being compared to different wines numbered 1 to n, where n is the total number of wines used (ordered, distinct numerical values), the best visualization to visualize the results would be a line plot. The visualization of the results would include the different wines (numbered) on the x-axis and their ratings from 0-10 on the y-axis. It will show the relative relationship between the different wines, with the newly introduced wine included, and their relative wine quality ratings.\n"
